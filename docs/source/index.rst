Recorder
========

**A Multi-Level Library for Understanding I/O Activity in HPC
Applications**

Quickstart
----------

**1. Build**

Recorder requires MPI and HDF5 to build. Please make sure they are installed
before building Recorder.

Run the following to fetch, build, and install Recorder.

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/uiuc-hpc/Recorder.git
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   cd Recorder
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install location]
   make
   make install

**2. Run**

Assume ``$RECORDER_ROOT`` is the location where you installed Recorder.
Do do a ``tree $RECORDER_ROOT`` should print out the following:

.. code:: bash

    ├── bin
    │   ├── conflict-detector
    │   ├── recorder2text
    │   ├── recorder2timeline
    │   └── recorder-summary
    ├── include
    │   ├── gotcha
    │   │   ├── gotcha.h
    │   │   └── gotcha_types.h
    │   ├── recorder.h
    │   ├── recorder-logger.h
    │   ├── recorder-utils.h
    │   └── uthash.h
    ├── lib
    │   ├── libreader.so
    │   ├── librecorder.so -> librecorder.so.2.5.0
    │   └── librecorder.so.2.5.0
    ...


Now let's run an application with Recorder to collect it traces.
We will use a simple MPI program as our targeting application.
Go to the Recorder's source directory and run the following.

.. code:: bash

    cd test && mpicc test_mpi.c -o test_mpi.exe
    mpirun -np N -env LD_PRELOAD $RECORDER_ROOT/lib/librecorder.so ./test_mpi.exe

After completion, you will see a folder named ``recorder-yyyymmdd``. This is a parent folder
that contains all traces folders generated on *yyyymmdd*.
Inside it, you will find the actual trace forlder of the application you just run.
It's folder name is ecoded as ``hostname-username-appname-pid-starttime``.

**3. Examine the traces**

Recorder provides several useful tools under ``l$RECORDER_ROOT/bin$`` for analysis.
Among them, *recorder2text* is used to convert the Recorder-format traces to plain text files.

.. code:: bash

   $RECORDER_ROOT/bin/recorder2text /path/to/your_trace_folder/

This will generate text fomart traces under ``/path/to/your_trace_folder/_text``.
You will see *N* [pid].txt files, where *N* is the number processors you run your application.
Each of these txt files contains the traces generated by one processor indicated by the [pid].
